# About this package

This package was developed by the [NCSA](https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu) [Visual Analytics Team](https://www.visualanalytics.ncsa.illinois.edu/about-us) to improve upon the accessibility of high quality GWAS visualizations for researchers with limited compute.

This is a modified version of the Dash Bio's [ManhattanPlot](https://dash.plotly.com/dash-bio/manhattanplot) function with two new parameters: `additional_highlight_row` and `additional_highlight_val`. 

Please see the `example/demo.ipynb` for details
